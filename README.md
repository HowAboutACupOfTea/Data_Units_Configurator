# Data_Units_Configurator

This application connects different extension units with each other to produce a visible output.

- DataSourceUnit (DSU)
- DataProcessingUnit (DPU)
- DataVisualizationUnit (DVU)

The functionality of the units is from dlls which can be included in the program without having the source code of this application. This works by using reflection.
